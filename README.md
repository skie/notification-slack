# CakePHP SlackNotification Plugin

The **SlackNotification** plugin allows you to send notifications to Slack using both the modern Block Kit API and legacy attachments via webhooks using the CakePHP Notification plugin. Slack is a popular team collaboration platform used by millions of organizations worldwide.

The plugin supports two integration methods: Incoming Webhooks for simple one-way communication and Web API for full Slack API access with advanced features. It provides a fluent API for building rich interactive messages with blocks, buttons, images, and sections.

The plugin uses the CakePHP HTTP client with no external dependencies, provides full type safety with PHPStan Level 8 compliance, and includes comprehensive test coverage. It integrates seamlessly with CakePHP's Notification system.
